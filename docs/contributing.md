# Contributing Guide

## Overview

This repository employs a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) setup with [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), and hosts a number of associated but separated packages in the `packages` directory:

- `@vuepress/core`: The VuePress core. Provides pure Node API to generate VuePress app, including page handling, plugin system and data preparation.

- `@vuepress/client`: The VuePress client package. Provides the client entry, and exports types and composable utils that can be used in client side development.

- `@vuepress/bundler-vite`: The VuePress bundler package with vite. Use vite to `dev` and `build` VuePress app that generated by `@vuepress/core`.

- `@vuepress/bundler-webpack`: The VuePress bundler package with webpack. Use webpack to `dev` and `build` VuePress app that generated by `@vuepress/core`.

- `@vuepress/cli`: The VuePress command line interface (CLI) package. It will resolve user config file, and create VuePress app with `@vuepress/core`, then execute corresponding command.

- `@vuepress/theme-default`: The VuePress default theme.

- `@vuepress/plugin-${name}`: Official plugins.

- `@vuepress/shared`: Utilities that shared between node side and client side.

- `@vuepress/utils`: Utilities that should only be used in node side.

- `vuepress`: A wrapper of `vuepress-vite`.

- `vuepress-vite`: A wrapper of `@vuepress/cli` + `@vuepress/bundler-vite` + `@vuepress/theme-default`. If users want to use default theme with vite, they can simply install this package.

- `vuepress-webpack`: A wrapper of `@vuepress/cli` + `@vuepress/bundler-webpack` + `@vuepress/theme-default`. If users want to use default theme with webpack, they can simply install this package.

## Development Setup

Pre-requirement:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 14+**
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) **version 7+**

Clone the repo, and install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build source code:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Start developing the documentation site:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

Main tools that used in this project:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) + [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code linting and formatting

## Scripts

### `pnpm build`

The `build` script uses `tsc` and `tsup` to compile TypeScript source files to JavaScript dist files.

Also, it will copy necessary resources from source directory to dist directory, because some source files (e.g. `.vue`, `.css` files) would not be processed by `tsc` nor `tsup`, but should keep the same relative path in the dist directory.

You may need to run this script first after your clone this repository, because the dist files are ignored by `.gitignore`.

### `pnpm clean`

The `clean` script runs `clean` script in all packages, cleaning all the dist files and caches. In other words, it will remove all the files that generated by `build`, `copy` and `dev` scripts.

It's used before you want to re-build source files from a clean / initial state.

### `pnpm dev:*`

The `dev:` prefix indicates that these scripts are for development, running corresponding script in watch mode.

### `pnpm docs:*`

#### `pnpm docs:build`, `pnpm docs:dev`, `pnpm docs:clean`

The `docs:` prefix indicates that these scripts are for documentation, i.e. the `docs` directory.

VuePress is using itself to build its own documentation site.

You need to run `pnpm build` to build VuePress source files first, then run these `docs:` scripts to develop and build our documentation.

#### `pnpm docs:serve`

Serve the documentation site locally.

You need to run `pnpm docs:build` first to generate the documentation dist files, and then run `pnpm docs:serve` to serve them.

### `pnpm lint`

The `lint` script uses ESLint to check all source files.

### `pnpm test`

The `test` script uses Jest to run unit testings.

## Documentation

VuePress documentation is powered by VuePress itself, which is built from the source code of this repository.

All the markdown source files are placed in `docs` directory. We are maintaining two translations:

- English (en-US) in `/` path
- Chinese (zh-CN) in `/zh/` path

We have two different deployments:

- Release deployment powered by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). This deployment is built from the latest released version, so users will not see unreleased changes. The domain name is [https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org).
- Developer deployment powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). This deployment is built from the latest commit, so developers could preview the latest changes. The domain name is [https://vuepress.github.io](https://vuepress.github.io).
