# Page

VuePress is markdown-centered. Each markdown file inside your project is a standalone page.

## Routing

By default, the route path of a page is determined by the relative path of your markdown file.

Assuming this is the directory structure of your markdown files:

```
└─ docs
   ├─ guide
   │  ├─ getting-started.md
   │  └─ README.md
   ├─ contributing.md
   └─ README.md
```

Take the `docs` directory as your [sourceDir](../reference/cli.md), e.g. you are running `vuepress dev docs` command. Then the route paths of your markdown files would be:

| Relative Path               | Route Path                    |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `/README.md`                | `/`                           |
| `/index.md`                 | `/`                           |
| `/contributing.md`          | `/contributing.html`          |
| `/guide/README.md`          | `/guide/`                     |
| `/guide/getting-started.md` | `/guide/getting-started.html` |

::: tip
By default, both `README.md` and `index.md` would be converted to `index.html` and generate a slash-ending route path. However, it might cause conflicts if you want to keep both of the two files.

In such case, you can set the [pagePatterns](../reference/config.md#pagepatterns) to avoid one of them being processed by VuePress, e.g. use `['**/*.md', '!**/README.md', '!.vuepress', '!node_modules']` to exclude all `README.md` files.

## Frontmatter

A markdown file could contain a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) frontmatter. The frontmatter must be at the top of the Markdown file and must be wrapped with a couple of triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:

```md
---
lang: en-US
title: Title of this page
description: Description of this page
---
```

You must have noticed that those fields are similar with the [Site Config](./configuration.md#site-config) in the [Config File](./configuration.md#config-file). You can override `lang`, `title`, `description`, etc., of current page via frontmatter. So you can take frontmatter as page scope config.

Also, VuePress has built-in support for some frontmatter fields, and your theme may have its own special frontmatter, too.

::: tip
Check out the [Frontmatter Reference](../reference/frontmatter.md) for a full list of VuePress built-in frontmatter.

Check out the [Default Theme > Frontmatter Reference](../reference/default-theme/frontmatter.md) for the frontmatter of default theme.

## Content

The main content of your page is written in Markdown. VuePress will firstly transform your Markdown to HTML code, then treat the HTML code as `<template>` of Vue SFC.

With the power of [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) and Vue template syntax, the basic Markdown can be extended a lot. Next, check out the [Markdown](./markdown.md) guide for all the extensions of Markdown in VuePress.
