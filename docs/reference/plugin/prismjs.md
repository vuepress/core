# prismjs

<NpmBadge package="@vuepress/plugin-prismjs" />

This plugin will enable syntax highlighting for markdown code fence with [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/).

This plugin has been integrated into the default theme.

Notice that this plugin would only tokenize the code fence without adding styles. When using it with a custom theme, you may need to choose and import Prism.js style theme yourself.

## Usage

```bash
npm i -D @vuepress/plugin-prismjs@next
```

```ts
import { prismjsPlugin } from '@vuepress/plugin-prismjs'

export default {
  plugins: [
    prismjsPlugin({
      // options
    }),
  ],
}
```

## Options

### preloadLanguages

- Type: `string[]`

- Default: `['markdown', 'jsdoc', 'yaml']`

- Details:

  Languages to preload.

  By default, languages will be loaded on demand when parsing markdown files.

  However, Prism.js has [some potential issues](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/issues/2716) about loading languages dynamically. To avoid them, you can preload languages via this option.
