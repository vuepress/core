<NpmBadge package="@vuepress/plugin-git" />

This plugin will collect git information of your pages, including the created and updated time, the contributors, etc.

The [lastUpdated](../default-theme/config.md#lastupdated) and [contributors](../default-theme/config.md#contributors) of default theme is powered by this plugin.

This plugin is mainly used to develop themes. You won't need to use it directly in most cases.

## Usage

```bash
npm i -D @vuepress/plugin-git@next
```

```js
const { gitPlugin } = require('@vuepress/plugin-git')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    gitPlugin({
      // options
    }),
  ],
}
```

## Git Repository

This plugin requires your project to be inside a [Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository), so that it can collect information from the commit history.

You should ensure all commits are available when building your site. For example, CI workflows usually clone your repository with [--depth 1](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---depthltdepthgt) to avoid fetching all commits, so you should disable the behavior to make this plugin work properly in CI.

::: warning
This plugin will significantly slow down the speed of data preparation, especially when you have a lot of pages. You can consider disabling this plugin in `dev` mode to get better development experience.
