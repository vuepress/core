<NpmBadge package="@vuepress/plugin-shiki" />

This plugin will enable syntax highlighting for markdown code fence with [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/).

::: tip
[Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/) is the syntax highlighter being used by VSCode. It has higher fidelity, but it is slower than [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/).

You could consider disabling this plugin in `dev` mode to get better development experience.
