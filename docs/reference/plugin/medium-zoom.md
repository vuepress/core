This plugin has been integrated into the default theme.

## Usage

```bash

```

const { mediumZoomPlugin } = require('@vuepress/plugin-medium-zoom')

      // options
    }),
  ],
}
```

## Options

  By default this plugin will make all images zoomable except those inside `<a>` tags.

## Composition API

### useMediumZoom

- Details:

  Returns the `Zoom` instance that used by this plugin, so that you can use the instance [methods](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom#methods) directly.

  This plugin will make images zoomable after navigating to current page. But if you are going to add new images dynamically, you may need this method to make those new images zoomable, too.

  This plugin adds an extra `refresh` method on the `Zoom` instance, which will call `zoom.detach()` then `zoom.attach()` with the [selector](#selector) as the default parameter. It will help you to refresh the zoomable images for current page.

- Example:

```ts
import { nextTick } from 'vue'
import { useMediumZoom } from '@vuepress/plugin-medium-zoom/lib/client'

export default {
  setup() {
    const zoom = useMediumZoom()

    // ... do something to add new images in current page
  
    // then you may need to call `refresh` manually to make those new images zoomable
    nextTick(() => {
      zoom.refresh()
    })
  },
}
```
