title: nprogress

<!-- `# nprogress` will be rendered as `<h1 id="nprogress">`, and the id will conflict with the nprogress bar (stupid) -->

<!-- so we add a 'plugin' suffix in the h1 title, and use title frontmatter to set the page title -->

# nprogress Plugin

<NpmBadge package="@vuepress/plugin-nprogress" />

Integrate [nprogress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress) into VuePress, which can provide a progress bar when navigating to another page.

## Styles

You can customize the style of the progress bar via CSS variables:

@[code css](@vuepress/plugin-nprogress/src/client/styles/vars.css)
